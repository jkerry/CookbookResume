\begin{rSection}{Research}

\begin{rSubsection}{University of Georgia, Department of Plant Biology}{January 2009 - May 2013}{}{}
\item \textbf{Thesis: System-Based Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Network Analyses in Papaver Somniferum} \\
Developed a novel protocol for the clustering of transcripts from a de novo assembly of closely related species using weighted correlation network analysis. The results of these analyses included support for known relationships between genes in the morphine biosynthesis pathway as well as the identification of a host of genes that may be related to the greater benzylisoquineoline alkaloid biosynthesis pathway.
\\
\item \textbf{Momany Laboratory: Bioinformatics} \\
Volunteered as a bioinformatician for the Momany Laboratory. Performed reference based sequence assembly and differential expression analysis of various filamentous fungus species. Collaborated with the Leebens-Mack laboratory in developing custom analysis tools using poisson distribution based statistical models. Instructed department graduate students in bioinformatic methods and statistical analysis of computational-biology data.
